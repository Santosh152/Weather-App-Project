# Weather-App-Project
In this weather app project, users can enter any city name to get the 5-day weather forecast 
or 
simply click on the “Use Current Location” button to get their current location’s weather details,
including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more. 
This project is also mobile-friendly, which means it looks great on all devices.
